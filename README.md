This project is creating a phylogenetic tree based on sequencing data of 3 variants of Toxoplasma gondii histone 2A (1, X, and Z), histone 2B, and histone 4.
## Background
Toxoplasma gondii (Toxoplasma) is an extremely successful parasite that infects almost every species of mammal and bird. It is closely related to other species of apicomplexan parasites, such as Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium species, which also cause serious disease in humans. Toxoplasma has the ability to clonally reproduce in intermediate hosts and causes an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, pregnant people, fetuses, and infants (Chen, 2021). The initial symptoms of Toxoplasma infection are similar to the flu, but the disease can progress in at-risk patients. In pregnant people, infection can result in miscarraige, birth defects, or stillbirth. In immunocompromised patients, infection can result in fever, headache, nausea, and confusion that persists after the initial infection period. Because Toxoplasma can infect any tissue in the body, it can also cause a serious ocular infection. Symptoms of an ocular Toxoplasma infection include blurry vision, eye pain, tears, and sensitivity to light (Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). 

The transition between the life cycle stages of Toxoplasma is mediated by epigenetic regulation (Nardelli et. al, 2013). Several types of proteins are involved in epigenetic regulation, including histones and bromodomain proteins. Histones exist as octamers composed of H2A, H2B, H3, and/or H4. They help to package the genome. Histone variants and modifications can be associated with either activation or repression of transcription. Within the types of histones, there are variants. The H2A histone has three variants: H2A.Z, H2A.X, and H2A.1. The variant H2A.Z has been associated with gene regulation, particularly the activation of genes (Giamo et. al, 2019). The variant H2A.1 interacts with H2Bv during gene activation, and it is the most conserved variant of H2A (Dalmasso et. al, 2009). H2A.X, unlike the other two variants, is associated with gene silencing and gene repair. The H2B variant H2Bv interacts with both H2A.Z and H2A.1 during gene activation. Lastly, H4 is the most conserved across species of any of these histones, only differing from human H4 by 6 amino acids (Nardelli et. al, 2013).

This investigation analyzes the gene sequences of H2A.Z, H2A.X, H2A.1, H2Bv, and H4 to build a phylogenetic tree showing the relationships between the genes. It was hypothesized that H2A.Z and H2A.1 will be the most genetically similar because they both interact with H2Bv during gene activation.
